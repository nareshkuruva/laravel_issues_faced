Issue:
When using ModelName::find($id) does the find function only search the database table for a column called id ?

So if my index and auto-increment column is called family_member_id, I am getting an error like undefined column..

Ans:

You can add a $primaryKey attribute to YOUR MODEL to specify a custom primary key name public $primarykey = 'family_member_id';

ex:
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class FamilyMembers extends Model
{
    public $primaryKey = 'family_member_id';
}

From the docs :
Eloquent will also assume that each table has a primary key column named id. You may define a $primaryKey property to override
this convention.
