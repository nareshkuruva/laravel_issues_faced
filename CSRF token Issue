Exception: laravel 5.4 --> The page has expired due to inactivity. Please refresh and try again.But if I change the method to GET, it works fine.

Solution:


This problem comes from the CSRF token verification which fails. So either you're not posting one or you're posting an incorrect one.

The reason it works for GET is that for a GET route in Laravel, there is no CSRF token posted.

You can either post a CSRF token in your form by calling:

{{ csrf_field() }}

=========================================================================================
THE BELOW ONE IS NOT A GOOD APPROACH:

Or exclude your route (NOT RECOMMENDED DUE TO SECURITY) in app/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php:

protected $except = [
    'your/route'
];
=======================
