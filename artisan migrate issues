Exception:
      PDOException::("SQLSTATE[42S01]: Base table or view already exists: 1050 Table 'users' already exists")
      C:\xampp\htdocs\dynasty\vendor\laravel\framework\src\Illuminate\Database\Connection.php:458

Solution:
Here are the steps I took to solve the same issue:

=> In the console I wrote "php artisan tinker"
=> Then, again in the console,  Schema::drop('users')
=> At the end php artisan migrate and it all worked.

For below Exception:

PDOException::("SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1071 Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes")

Solution:

As outlined in the Migrations guide to fix this all you have to do is edit your AppServiceProvider.php file and inside the boot method 
set a default string length:

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;   //include this
public function boot()
{
    Schema::defaultStringLength(191);   //add this
}
File Path: roopath./app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php
