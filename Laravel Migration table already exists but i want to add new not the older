Issue : I previously created users table. Now I have created a new migration to create a new books table inside my schema. When I try to run the command

php artisan migrate
It shows:

    [Illuminate\Database\QueryException]
    SQLSTATE[42S01]: Base table or view already exists: 1050 Table 'users' alre
    ady exists (SQL: create table `users` (`id` int unsigned not null auto_incr
    ement primary key, `username` varchar(255) not null, `email` varchar(255) n
    ot null, `password` varchar(255) not null, `created_at` timestamp default 0
     not null, `updated_at` timestamp default 0 not null) default character set
     utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci)
Here is my new migration table:

<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

class CreateBooksTable extends Migration {
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('books', function(Blueprint $table)
        {
            $table->increments('id');
            $table->string('name');
            $table->string('auther');
            $table->string('area');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    public function down()
    {
        Schema::drop('books');
    }
}
How can I get rid of the error?




ANS :

You need to run

php artisan migrate:rollback
if that also fails just go in and drop all the tables which you may have to do as it seems your migration table is messed up or your user table when you ran a previous rollback did not drop the table.

EDIT:

The reason this happens is that you ran a rollback previously and it had some error in the code or did not drop the table. This still however messes up the laravel migration table and as far as it's concerned you now have no record of pushing the user table up. The user table does already exist however and this error is throw.
