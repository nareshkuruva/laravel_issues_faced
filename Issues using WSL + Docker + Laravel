The stream or file "/var/www/html/storage/logs/laravel.log" could not be opened in append mode: Failed to open stream: Permission denied
---------------------------------------

Assuming that your user should be the owner, type the following command:

sudo chown -R user:www-data /path/of/your/laravel/project
Then give the user and webserver permissions as follows:

sudo find /path/of/your/laravel/project -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
then run:

sudo find /path/of/your/laravel/project -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
After you run those commands, go to your Laravel folder and give the webserver rights to read/write to your bootstrap/cache and storage folder:

sudo chgrp -R www-data storage bootstrap/cache
sudo chmod -R ug+rwx storage bootstrap/cache

--------------------
Example:
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data connect-laravel
sudo find cnew -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
sudo find cnew -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;

sudo chgrp -R www-data storage bootstrap/cache  
sudo chmod -R ug+rwx storage bootstrap/cache

sudo chown -R <user-name> <directory_name>

Your lock file does not contain a compatible set of packages. Please run composer update.

Problem 1
    - laravel/framework is locked to version v8.24.0 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - laravel/framework v8.24.0 requires ext-mbstring * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's mbstring extension.
	
Ans: That might be some packages missing or not installed composer in ubuntu... so run composer install in docker CLI	(or)

run below commands to update/install packages in ubuntu

sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl php-cli php-mbstring git unzip

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install php-xml  (php-xml has all the related packages including ext-dom)
Most likely you are missing mbstring too. If you get the error, install this package as well with:

sudo apt-get install php-mbstring

Illuminate\Database\QueryException 

  SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not known
  
  
Ans:  The error show up when you test on local, right? You need to update /.env with the actual database connection parameters.
 Better you should run Docker CLI.. it wont give any error.
 .env database configuration is configured to docker host but you are running migrate in local..

"HY000" is a general server error (see Server Error Codes and Messages in MySQL docs).
"2002" is MySQL Client Error Code meaning "Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket" (see (Client Error Codes and Messages in MySQL docs).
The driver specific error code and message ("php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not known") 
tell you that PDO is not able to resolve the host name.
The stack trace you attached, line 3, reveals that you did not specify the database connection parameters in the configuration file. 
The error show up when you test on local, right? You need to update /.env with the actual database connection parameters.

Blade templating (<livewire:...) happens BEFORE the browser loads the page, and Alpine templating happens AFTER the browser loads the page.

Both x-for and x-if are templating done by Alpine, so due to the order of operations that Caleb mentioned (Livewire before, then Alpine after the page loads), 
what you're trying to do will not work.
